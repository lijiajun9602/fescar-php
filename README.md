# Introduce

[Seata](https://github.com/seata/seata) is a very mature distributed transaction framework, and is the de facto standard platform for distributed transaction technology in the Java field. [Seata-PHP](https://github.com/seata/seata-php) is the implementation version of PHP language in Seata multilingual ecosystem, which realizes the interoperability between Java and PHP, so that PHP developers can also use Seata-PHP to realize distributed transactions.

> **Before learning about the ` Seata-PHP `, let's first understand what's the ` Seata `**

## What is Seata?

A **distributed transaction solution** with high performance and ease of use for **microservices** architecture.
### Distributed Transaction Problem in Microservices

Let's imagine a traditional monolithic application. Its business is built up with 3 modules. They use a single local data source.

Naturally, data consistency will be guaranteed by the local transaction.

![Monolithic App](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i3/O1CN01FTtjyG1H4vvVh1sNY_!!6000000000705-0-tps-1106-678.jpg)

Things have changed in a microservices architecture. The 3 modules mentioned above are designed to be 3 services on top of 3 different data sources ([Pattern: Database per service](http://microservices.io/patterns/data/database-per-service.html)). Data consistency within every single service is naturally guaranteed by the local transaction.

**But how about the whole business logic scope?**

### How Seata do?

Seata is just a solution to the problem mentioned above.

Firstly, how to define a **Distributed Transaction**?

We say, a **Distributed Transaction** is a **Global Transaction** which is made up with a batch of **Branch Transaction**, and normally **Branch Transaction** is just **Local Transaction**.

![Global & Branch](https://cdn.nlark.com/lark/0/2018/png/18862/1545015454979-a18e16f6-ed41-44f1-9c7a-bd82c4d5ff99.png)

There are three roles in Seata Framework:

- **Transaction Coordinator(TC):** Maintain status of global and branch transactions, drive the global commit or rollback.

- **Transaction Manager(TM):** Define the scope of global transaction: begin a global transaction, commit or rollback a global transaction.

- **Resource Manager(RM):** Manage resources that branch transactions working on, talk to TC for registering branch transactions and reporting status of branch transactions, and drive the branch transaction commit or rollback.

![Model](https://cdn.nlark.com/lark/0/2018/png/18862/1545013915286-4a90f0df-5fda-41e1-91e0-2aa3d331c035.png)

A typical lifecycle of Seata managed distributed transaction:

1. TM asks TC to begin a new global transaction. TC generates an XID representing the global transaction.

2. XID is propagated through microservices' invoke chain.

3. RM registers local transaction as a branch of the corresponding global transaction of XID to TC.

4. TM asks TC for committing or rollbacking the corresponding global transaction of XID.

5. TC drives all branch transactions under the corresponding global transaction of XID to finish branch committing or rollbacking.

![Typical Process](https://cdn.nlark.com/lark/0/2018/png/18862/1545296917881-26fabeb9-71fa-4f3e-8a7a-fc317d3389f4.png)
